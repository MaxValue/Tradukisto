Please, keep alphabetical order when adding application informations. This will eventually make searching easier, until we get so much entries that we will need to categorize them.

== Logical Desktop ==
Logical Desktop (LD) is a "desktop environment" written in PyQt (and soon PyKDE). In LD, you work by executing "actions", which are composed of one "verb" and one or more "objects" (e.g. "Print" is the verb, and the objects are the printer, the files to print, and the program used for printing).

In all desktop environments you specify "verbs" and "objects", in one way or another. What's new about Logical Desktop is _how_ you specify those things: 1) in any order 2) with automatic hiding of the things that don't make sense. Feature (1) enables LD to unify the "task-oriented" and "document-oriented" styles of interaction. Feature (2) is called "reciprocal incremental list narrowing" and allows you to find the right item to click much easier. <<BR>> Author: Maurizio Colucci <<BR>> Link: http://logicaldesktop.sourceforge.net/
