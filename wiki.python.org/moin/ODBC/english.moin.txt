= ODBC =
WikiPedia:ODBC stands for ''Open Database Connectivity'', the industry standard for database C APIs.

Most databases ship with ODBC drivers, so chances are high that you can use one of these drivers together with a Python ODBC interface to connect your Python application with any database on the market.

Since all ODBC Python interfaces need ODBC drivers to connect to the databases, we're hosting a [[ODBCDrivers|list of ODBC drivers]] on a separate page.

mxODBC Connect is a commercial client-server product that allows connecting Python to ODBC compatible databases running on remote servers without requiring an ODBC driver on the client side. The product uses mxODBC on the server side and provides a highly portable Python library for the client side. As such it supports all database backend that mxODBC supports, but allows connecting to these from many different Python-supported platforms.

mxODBC Connect supports asynchronous query execution via the popular [[http://www.gevent.org/|gevent package]], provides secure certificate based authentication, SSL encrypted database connections, comes with full support for stored procedures, multiple result sets, Unicode, a common interface on all platforms and implements [[http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxODBCConnect/#Features|many other useful features]].

For ODBC drivers supported on the server side, please see the mxODBC entry.

One pure Python script, runs on CPython / IronPython / PyPy , Version 2.4 / 2.5 / 2.6 / 2.7 / 3.2 / 3.3, Win / Linux , 32 / 64 bit.

Almost totally same usage as pyodbc ( can be seen as a re-implementation of pyodbc in pure Python ).

Simple - the whole module is implemented in a single python script with less than 3000 lines.

This interface is rather old, mostly unmaintained and only provides an DB-API 1.0 interface, but listed here since it started the Python DB-API specification development back in 1996.
