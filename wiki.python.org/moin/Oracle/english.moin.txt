Note that if not running under Jython, JPype is required. Use code like the following:

{{{#!python
environ['JAVA_HOME'] = '/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre'
jpype.startJVM(jpype.getDefaultJVMPath(), '-Djava.class.path=ojdbc6.jar')
conn = jaydebeapi.connect('oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver', 'jdbc:oracle:thin:user/pass@server:1521:dbname')

mxODBC Connect is a commercial client-server product that allows connecting Python to ODBC compatible databases running on remote servers without requiring an ODBC driver on the client side. The product uses mxODBC on the server side and provides a highly portable Python library for the client side. As such it supports all database backend that mxODBC supports, but allows connecting to these from many different Python-supported platforms.

mxODBC Connect supports asynchronous query execution via the popular [[http://www.gevent.org/|gevent package]], provides secure certificate based authentication, SSL encrypted database connections, comes with full support for stored procedures, multiple result sets, Unicode, a common interface on all platforms and implements [[http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxODBCConnect/#Features|many other useful features]].

mxODBC Connect Server is compatible with the [[http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/oci/instantclient/index.html|Oracle Instant Client]] ODBC drivers.
