# WikiWork

*my complete work on various wikis*

## How to use

This repo contains all wiki pages i’ve edited. Each pages history starts with the first edit i’ve made and continues to the last edit i’ve made. The folder structure starts with the wiki URL, followed by the folder structure in the respective wiki. This goes down until the specific article as a folder. Inside the article folder are the text files containing the wiki markup of the page, each file is for another language. For example the file `english.moin` tells us that this is the file for the english language in the „MoinMoin“ wiki markup language.
